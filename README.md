service level agreement (SLA) to a ticket to specify the service commitments that must be met either by the service provider or the customer. SLA are targets I have to meet for doing certain things like: How quickly I assign a ticket to a person, how quickly I initially reached out to the user etc. An SLA is essential in ensuring both parties are on the same page in terms of standards and service.
